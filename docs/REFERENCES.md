[What is a Geostationary Satellite](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/backgrounders/remote-sensing)
"Geostationary satellites follow the Earthâ€™s rotation and travel at the same rate of the rotation; because of this, the satellites appear to an observer on Earth to be fixed in one location. These satellites capture the same view of Earth with each observation and so provide almost continuous coverage of one area. Weather satellites such as the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) series are examples of geostationary satellites."
